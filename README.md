# Battle Tank Game

Part of an online [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/overview) walked me through creating this game using Unreal Engine and a lot of C++ behind the scenes. The game has the player control a tank in a enclosed battleground where other hostiles (AI) are attacking to win.
